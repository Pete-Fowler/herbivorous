      "description": "All it takes are 10 ingredients and a little time to batch up homemade veggie burgers that are packed with dynamic flavor and texture. “Mushrooms add rich umami to vegan burgers, and they’re naturally low in sodium and saturated fat,” says dietitian and heart health coach Heather Shasa.",
      "steps": "Step 1\nCook quinoa in a large saucepan of lightly salted boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender, 8–10 minutes. Drain well and let cool at least 10 minutes.\n\nStep 2\nMeanwhile, heat ¼ cup oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add chickpeas (make sure they are well drained) and cook, tossing occasionally, until lightly browned, 8–10 minutes. Add garlic powder and paprika and toss a few times to coat. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool about 5 minutes.",

      "steps": "\nStep 1\nGrind onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and chile pepper together in a food processor into a paste.\n\nStep 2\nHeat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour the paste into the skillet and cook until the oil begins to separate from the mixture and is golden brown in color, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the mixture with chili powder, coriander, gram masala, turmeric, and salt; cook and stir until very hot, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nStep 3\nStir enough water into the mixture to get a thick gravy; bring to a boil and stir chickpeas into the gravy. Reduce heat to medium and cook until the chickpeas are heated through, 5 to 7 minutes. Garnish with cilantro.\n\nAs an optional serving suggestion, use the \"Indian Naan Bread\" recipe instead of rice as a companion to this dish.",
      "description": "Give this chana masala dish a try and don't look back. Indian food is not just curried sauces. It's not too exotic either, unless \"exotic\" is code for \"yummy and full of flavor.\"",
